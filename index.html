                    <h3>Data Cleaning & Preparation</h3>
                    <p>Retrieving data from one or more sources can yield with different columns names and data types.Handling missing and inconsistent data that may affect your analysis.
                        Data cleaning isn’t always considered “sexy”, but preparing data can actually be a lot of fun when treated as a problem-solving exercise.</p>

                    <h3>Data Analysis & Exploration</h3>
                    <p>Taking a business question or need and turning it into a data question. Data exploration is looking to find interesting trends or relationships in the data that could bring value to a business.
                        Exploration might be guided by an original business question, but it also might be relatively unguided. By looking to find patterns and blips in the data, you may stumble across an opportunity for the business to decrease costs or increase growth!</p>

                    <h3>Data Visualizations</h3>
                    <p> Humans are visual creatures, and most people aren’t going to be able to get meaningful insight by looking at a giant spreadsheet of numbers.
                    Creating clean, visually compelling charts that will help others understand the data. It also means avoiding things that are either difficult to interpret (like pie charts) or can be misleading (like manipulating axis values).</p>
