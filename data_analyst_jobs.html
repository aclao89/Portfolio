        <ul>
            <li>Pandas: data manipulation and analysis tool built on Python</li>
            <li>Numpy: library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices</li>
            <li>Matplotlib: comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python</li>
            <li>Seaborn: Python data visualization library based on matplotlib</li>
            <li>Folium: a powerful Python library that helps you create several types of Leaflet maps</li>
            <li>Plotly: interactive, open-source, and browser-based graphing library for Python</li>

            <li>Scikit-Learn: a predictive data analysis toolkit</li>
            <li>Yellowbrick: a suite of visual analysis and diagnostic tools designed to facilitate machine learning with scikit-learn.</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Data Cleaning:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove 'Unnamed: 0' column --> .drop() method</li>
            <li>Parse the Lower and Upper Bounds of Salary Estimate, Company Size, and Revenue for granular analysis --> for loop with .replace(), .split() and .strip() methods</li>
            <li>Remove the "/n" in the Company Name column --> for loop with .split() method</li>
            <li>Rows with -1, '-1.0', and '1' were in place in certain columns. It seems like these values were input in place as Null values. I replaced them relevant values in each respective column.</li>
            <li><a href="https://opencagedata.com/api">OpenCage</a> Geocoding on the State column to obtain forward geocoding (text to lat/long) via a RESTful API.</li>

        <h4>What are the top 20 industries hiring during COVID19?</h4>
        <img src = "img/Da_jobs/top20industry.jpg">
        <ul>
        <li>The top 2 industries (IT Services and Staffing & Outsourcing) make up 29% of all Data Analyst jobs with a non-null Industry label. My guess would be that a lot of hiring is done by an intermediary Staffing & Outsourcing company as opposed to the actual job Industry.</li>
        <li>Outsourcing is cost- and time-efficient since it keeps finances flexible, not fixed. In-house – Hiring new staff members don't come cheap. Companies would have to face financial challenges with fixed HR expenses and even intangible costs like time to hire a full-time team. Companies are cutting costs due to the COVID19.</li>

    </ul>
        <h4>What are the top 20 companies hiring during COVID19?</h4>
            <img src = "img/Da_jobs/top20companies.png">
        <ul>
        <li>As previously mentioned, the first 8 companies are employment and recruitment agencies. The only non-staffing companies are Apple, MUFG (Financial Services), Citi, Bank of New York Mellon, and Molina Healthcare. Apple is a major technology company that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. Financial institutions and healthcare are essential businesses, required to combat the unprecedented times of COVID19.</li>

        <h4>What is the distribution of a data analyst's salary?</h4>

            <li>The lower and upper bound salary estimates are skewed right, meaning the mean is greater than the median.</li>
            <li>Overall, a Data Analyst can be considered a well paid role.</li>
    </ul>

        <h4>What are the top 20 industries hiring ordered by median salary?</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>The box plots seem to be all over the place. News outlet, chemical manufacturing, hotels only have one point so it's not truly representative since it's one sample for each of those industries.</li>
                <li>Let's establish a baseline of minimum number of job listings per industry. We will set the cutoff at 15 since that accounts for 90% of non-null postings.</li>

        <h2 class ="section__title section__title--services">Takeaways</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>As I am in the process of finding my first job as a data analyst, this project provided valuable insight that companies are actively hiring. Although big tech companies such as Uber, Airbnb, and LinkedIn exercised mass layoffs due to the COVID19. Many companies are cuttings costs to consolidate their spending since many are uncertain the length of shelter in place and looming residual effects on the economy. Tech giants such as Facebook and Google allowed their employees to work remotely until July 2021.</li>
            <li>The top 2 industries actively hiring are staffing agencies which make up nearly 30% of all Data Analyst jobs with a non-null entry. Outsourcing is cost- and time-efficient since it keeps finances flexible, not fixed. In-house – Hiring new staff members don't come cheap. Companies would have to face financial challenges with fixed HR expenses and even intangible costs like time to hire a full-time team. Companies are cutting costs due to the COVID19.</li>
            </li>
            <li>Nearly half of the top 20 companies hiring (by listings) are recruitment agencies. The only non-staffing companies are Apple, MUFG (Financial Services), Citi, Bank of New York Mellon, and Molina Healthcare.</li>
            <li>It's no surprise that California has the most job offerings due to its population, size, and Silicon Valley. Texas, New York, Illinois, Washington, and Colorado are flourishing tech hubs outside of the Silicon Valley.</li>
            <li>People actively on the job hunt may refer to the company ratings plot to filter out desired companies.</li>
            <li>For experienced applicants, the upper bound salary exceeds the median income of each associated states in 2017.</li>
